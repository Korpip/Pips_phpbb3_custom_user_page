Pips_phpbb3_custom_user_page
============================

This is a small mod I made to give users of my forum the ability to create their own user pages and also allow them to add their page to a public viewing list.

To install your phpBB3 install must be installed to /forum
Copy s.php and streamutils.php to root

In your Admin panel go to "Custom profile fields"

Create "user_banner" "textarea".
That will be an optional for for your users.

Create "acepage" "textarea" make sure to set max # of characters to something decent like 2000 and allow any characters.

Create "streamingnow" "Boolean (Yes/No)" Setting this toggle will place the user in the public viewing list.

I made user accounts with certain names.
You can see them in s.php in the nav section.
